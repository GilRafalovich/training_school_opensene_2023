#----------------------------------------------------------------- Hints for Exercise 1.1

# 1. load the cml data from netcdf, select a cml, channel and time range (see 1.1 to 1.4)


# 2. remove outliers (the values are -99.9 for rsl and 255 for tsl as shown in 2.2)


# 3. compute the trsl and name the new variable accordingly (see 2.3)


# 4. compute a rolling window standard deviation with window size 60 and location "center" (see 3.1)


# 5. use the standard deviation threshold of 0.8 to detect the wet periods (see 3.2)


# 6. Plot the resulting trsl and wet variables
